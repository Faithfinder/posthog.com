## Responsibilities

Our people team works across talent, people, operations, and culture. This is what we care about:

- Setting a very high bar for bringing people on board. We are always looking for _the_ best people in their field, or people on their way to becoming exceptional at their jobs. This is so important to us, it's enshrined in our [values](/handbook/company/values#talent-compounds).
- Supporting our team throughout the entire employee lifecycle - from [making an offer](/handbook/people/compensation), to [onboarding](/handbook/people/onboarding) and [progression](/handbook/people/career-progression), [time off](/handbook/people/time-off), and eventually [parting ways](/handbook/people/offboarding). 
- We create light-touch initiatives, systems, and processes that allow PostHog to act fast and [scale iteratively](/handbook/company/culture#iteration) 
- Building a [diverse and inclusive culture](/handbook/company/diversity) with a strong sense of belonging is at the heart of everything we do.

We use the RACI model to manage the various areas of focus within the team:
- R = Responsible - directly responsible for completing something
- A = Accountable - has final authority over completing something
- C = Consulted - needs to be brought in before a decision is made
- I = Informed - needs to be told when a decision is made

## Customer

Every PostHog team member, as well as current, future and past candidates. 

## Team 1-1s

On a monthly basis, Charles offers every team member a totally optional, informal check-in. The format isn’t strict, and we usually talk about how you are doing, what you think we could be doing better as a company, any particular worries/concerns you have, random cool ideas you just want to riff on, etc. Things that have come up in recent all hands or team surveys are usually topics we can go deep on as well. 

These conversations are confidential by default - Charles doesn’t share their content with anyone else unless explicitly asked to.

## Slack channels

- [#team-people-and-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/messages/team-people-and-ops) - internally public, default for ops & people discussions
- [#private-people-ops](https://posthog.slack.com/messages/private-people-ops) - internally confidential, for minority of issues, e.g. salaries, candidate offers
