## Mission

We build powerful visibility and debugging tools that enable our customers to go beyond the numbers. Our mission is to put product builders in the shoes of their users, capturing and re-creating the experience so that they can understand the nuances of _why_ their metrics changed. We aim to provide validation for their instincts, making it obvious what to do next.

- **Visibility** leads to **investigation** which leads to **understanding**.


## Q4 2023 Goals

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 1 : Project "NoteForce Exploration 3000" (Ben, David)

Why? Pairing up with Michael, Thomas, and Cory from Team Product Analytics to focus on not just releasing Notebooks, but integrating them seamlessly with PostHog 3000 to make it a great experience to explore any and all data across PostHog.

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal 2 : Mobile Session Replay

Why? - The people want it and we have the right skills in house to do a good job of this. Replay is the main focus, but making mobile a first-class citizen of PostHog is the real goal.

Follow along in [our Q4 MegaIssue](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/17803)

## Areas of responsibility

- **Session Replay** - recording browser or mobile sessions to be replayed later
- **Toolbar** - a floating helper on your web app that helps to toggle feature flags, display heatmaps and provide contextual analysis
- **Notebooks** - a way to explore your data in a free format environment, for example to add comments to a session replay
