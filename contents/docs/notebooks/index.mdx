> Notebooks are currently in **public beta**. This means it's not yet a perfect experience, but we'd love to know your thoughts. Please [share your feedback](http://app.posthog.com/home#supportModal) and [follow our roadmap](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/15680)!

Notebooks enable you to work with all of the various parts of PostHog and add your own notes and thoughts alongside them. 

Notebooks can feature text and images, as well as embedded insights, replays, feature flags, and events. This makes notebooks an ideal place to complete ad-hoc analysis, track bug investigations, plan feature releases, create internal documentation, and more.

## Adding and formatting text

Notebooks support all sorts of typical text editing features such as Headings, Bold, Italic, Lists etc. Currently the only supported method of doing these is via Markdown.

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3 
- List 
1. Numbered list
**Bold**
_italic_
`code`
```

You can also edit text by using the `+` icon which appears when the cursor is over a new line. 

## Embedding images and animations

Notebooks support adding images and animations from most major file types, including .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, and .gif. 

To add an image or animation to a notebook, simply drag and drop it into the notebook at the position you'd like to add it. 

Notebooks do not currently support adding video files, or HTML embeds for YouTube videos. 

## Embedding resources from PostHog

The real power of notebooks comes from the ability to embed other elements of PostHog within a document. This enables you to feature relevant insights alongside your analysis, for example, or attach session replays to a bug report. 

Notebooks currently support the following features as embedded items: 

- Session replays
- Replay playlists
- Persons and events
- Data exploration nodes, such as the Event Explorer
- Feature flags
- Insights
- HogQL queries

There are three ways you can add these elements into a notebook.

### Adding resources via a dropdown

When you have your cursor on an empty line a `+` will appear. Clicking that gives you a drop down of various things you can add, such as a Trend insight or session replay playlist. You can select what you need to add these items directly. 

### Adding resources via a slash command

You can also add PostHog resources to a notebook by using a slash command. Type `/` to summon the dropdown, or keep typing to focus it. 

You can type `/insight` to filter the menu towards product insights, for example. 

### Adding resources via drag and drop
The primary way of getting things into a notebook currently is drag and drop. You can drag many things from elsewhere in PostHog and just drop them into a notebook that is pinned to the side.

You can highlight any elements which can be drag-and-dropped in this way by holding the see what is currently supported you just have to hold down the `Alt` / `Option` key and any supported elements will be highlighted. 

You can then click and drag it into the notebook sidebar to add it to the currently opened notebook.
