Vercel supports [rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/project-configuration#rewrites) which we can use as a reverse proxy. Create a `vercel.json` file and add a `rewrites` object from the `/ingest` route to `https://app.posthog.com` or `https://eu.posthog.com`.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/ingest/:path*",
      "destination": "https://app.posthog.com/:path*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Once done, set the `/ingest` route of your domain as the API host in your PostHog initialization like this:

```js
posthog.init('<ph_project_api_key>',
  {
    api_host: 'https://www.your-domain.com/ingest',
  }
)
```

Once updated, deploy your changes on Vercel and check that PostHog requests are going to `https://www.your-domain.com/ingest` by checking the network tab on your domain.

> **Note:** Some frameworks, including [Astro](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/astro#can-i-use-vercel.json-to-create-rewrites-with-astro) and [SvelteKit](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/sveltekit#rewrites), don't support Vercel rewrites well. If you're using one of these frameworks, we recommend trying another proxy method.
